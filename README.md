# mpi-exp
Multiple problems solved both in serial and parallelized versions. Developed in 2016.

These algorithms are optimized to run on multiple processors with the MPI message-passing system. Most of these files expose some MPI feature, while the Game of Life implementation contains HPC optimizations and uses the interface appropriately.
